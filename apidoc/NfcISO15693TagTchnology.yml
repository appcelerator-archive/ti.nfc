summary: Provides access to ISO 15693 properties and I/O operations on a <Modules.Nfc.NfcTag>.
description: |
    The NFCTagReaderSessionDelegate receives an object that conforms to the NFCISO15693Tag protocol when the NFCTagReaderSession detects an ISO 15693-compatible tag. For the delegate to receive the tag object, your app must include the Near Field Communication Tag Reader Session Formats Entitlement.
    For the reader session to read and write data to the tag, it must be available to the reader session. Use the isAvailable property to check the tagâ€™s availability.
