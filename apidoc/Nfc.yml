summary: Near Field Communication (NFC) module
description: |
    This module provides access to Near Field Communication (NFC) functionality, allowing applications to read NDEF 
    messages in NFC tags. A "tag" may actually be another device that appears as a tag.

    ### NFC Resources

    -   [Near Field Communication](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/index.html)
    -   [android.nfc](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/nfc/package-summary.html)

    ### Requirements

    -   An NFC capable device is required.
    -   Android API level 10

    ### Getting Started

    -   View the [Using Titanium Modules](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Using_Titanium_Modules) 
        document for instructions on getting started with using this module in your application.

    ### Accessing the Module

    -   Use `require` to access this module from JavaScript:
            var nfc = require("ti.nfc");
        The `nfc` variable is a reference to the Module object.

    ### Tag Dispatching and Intent Filters

    -   The Android [tag dispatch system](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc.html#tag-dispatch)
        is responsible for dispatching NFC messages to the appropriate application. In the
        situation where you are not using foreground dispatching, you will need to define intent-filters in the 
        tiapp.xml file to specify which types of NFC messages the application wants to receive. By using intent-filters in
        the tiapp.xml file, the application will be automatically started if a matching
        NFC message is dispatched. 
  
        Add code similar to the following to your tiapp.xml file:

        - Replace occurrences of the activity name with your activity name.
        - `android:launchMode="singleTask"` is needed so that new intents that result from NFC message dispatching do not start a new activity in your application.
        - Replace the NFC specific intent filters with filters appropriate for your application.

                        <application>
                            <activity android:name=".TagviewerActivity"

                                    <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                                    <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
                                </intent-filter>
                                <intent-filter>
                                    <action android:name="android.nfc.action.NDEF_DISCOVERED"/>
                                    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
                                    <data android:mimeType="text/plain"/>
                                </intent-filter>
                                <intent-filter>
                                    <action android:name="android.nfc.action.NDEF_DISCOVERED"/>
                                    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
                                    <data android:scheme="http"/>
                                </intent-filter>
                            </activity>
                        </application>
                    </manifest>
                </android>

        Note that if you are using [foreground dispatching](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/advanced-nfc.html#foreground-dispatch)
        you do not need to define intent filters in the application's tiapp.xml file.

    ### Creating an Adapter

    -   The NFC adapter gives you access to the features of the NFC device. The NFC adapter proxy is always
        associated with the activity that was the current activity when it was created. Therefore, the NFC 
        Adapter should be created after the activity has been opened. You can use the window `open` event to know
        when the activity has been opened. 

            $.index.addEventListener('open', function(e) {
                nfcAdapter = nfc.createNfcAdapter({
                    onNdefDiscovered: handleDiscovery,
                    onTagDiscovered: handleDiscovery,
                    onTechDiscovered: handleDiscovery
                });
            });

    ### Handling Intents

    -   NFC Intents are dispatched to an activity by the Android tag dispatch system. When your activity receives a new intent,
        it must forward the intent to the `onNewIntent` method of the NFC adapter for processing.

            var act = Ti.Android.currentActivity;
            act.addEventListener('newintent', function(e) {
                nfcAdapter.onNewIntent(e.intent);
            });

        If your application is started as the result of an NFC intent, that intent will automatically be processed when the
        NFC module is loaded.

    ### Foreground Dispatch

    -   The foreground dispatch system allows an activity to intercept an intent and claim priority over other activities that handle the same intent.
        When using foreground dispatching, you must process the `pause` and `resume` events on the activity and enable or disable
        foreground dispatching.

            var act = Ti.Android.currentActivity;
            act.addEventListener('resume', function(e) {
                nfcAdapter.enableForegroundDispatch(dispatchFilter);
            });
            act.addEventListener('pause', function(e) {
                nfcAdapter.disableForegroundDispatch();
            });

    ### Example applications

    -   Example applications are located in the `example` folder of the module:

        - `TagBeam` demonstrates how to use Android Beam to send messages to another NFC capable device.
        - `TagForeground` demonstrates how to read NFC tags only when the application is in the foreground.
        - `TagViewer` demonstrates how to receive NFC tag intents even when the application is not running.

  - title: Creating NFC Adapter
    example: |
        This example demonstrates the proper technique for creating an NFC adapter in the current activity. The
        NFC Adapater should be created after the activity has been opened.

            var nfc = require('ti.nfc');
            var nfcAdapter = null;

            $.index.addEventListener('open', function(e) {
                // Must wait until the activity has been opened before setting up NFC
                // Create the NFC adapter to be associated with this activity. 
                // There should only be ONE adapter created per activity.
                nfcAdapter = nfc.createNfcAdapter({
                    onNdefDiscovered: handleDiscovery,
                    onTagDiscovered: handleDiscovery,
                    onTechDiscovered: handleDiscovery
                });

                // It's possible that the device does not support NFC. Check it here
                // before we go any further.
                if (!nfcAdapter.isEnabled()) {
                    alert('NFC is not enabled on this device');
                    return;
                }
            });

            $.index.open();
